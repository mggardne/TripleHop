# TripleHop
Matlab code for calculating joint angles from triple hop biplanar images.

Analyzes JPEG images of triple hop biplanar images in three different poses:  1.  Standing calibration pose (C), 2.  Initial impact pose (I) and 3.  Fully flexed pose (F).

File names must be in a specific format.  See comment above the file for reading the JPEG image files.

The frontal (F) and lateral (L) camera views are sychronized.  The reflective marker balls are listed in the comments about radio buttons.  Only the markers required to calculate the joint angles are digitized in each view.  The joints angles are described in the comments after the names of the radio buttons.

Please see the comments in thop_angg.m for more information.
