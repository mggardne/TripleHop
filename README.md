# TripleHop
Matlab code for calculating joint angles from triple hop biplanar images.

Analyzes JPEG images of triple hop biplanar images in three different poses:  1.  Standing calibration pose (C), 2.  Initial impact pose (I) and 3.  Fully flexed pose (F).

File names must be in a specific format.  See comment above the file read for the JPEG image files.

The frontal (F) and lateral (L) camera views are sychronized.  The reflective marker balls are listed in the comments.  Only the markers required to calculate the joint angles are digitized in each view.

See thop_angg.m comments for more information about using this code.
